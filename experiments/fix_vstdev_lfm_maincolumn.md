# Fix for vstDev Tree Indicators Issue #176 - LFM File Fix

## Problem Description

After PR #178 was merged (which added `vstDev.Header.MainColumn := 0` in code), the tree node expand/collapse indicators ("+"/"-") were still missing in the `vstDev` component.

User comments on issue #176:
1. "Первый столбец vstDev все также не содержит индикаторов разворачивания/сворачивания узлов" (First column still doesn't contain expand/collapse indicators)
2. "Первая колонка все равно перерисовываеся" (First column is still being redrawn)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Previous Fix (PR #178)
PR #178 correctly added this line to `velectrnav.pas` at line 320:
```pascal
vstDev.Header.MainColumn := 0; // Колонка 0 содержит индикаторы дерева (+/-)
```

### Why It Still Didn't Work

**The critical issue**: In Lazarus/FreePascal, the .lfm (form) file properties are loaded **AFTER** the component is created and initialized.

Timeline of events:
1. `TVElectrNav.Create` constructor runs
2. `AllSelActionExecute` is called (by user clicking "*" button)
3. `InitializeVstDev` is called → sets `MainColumn := 0` ✓
4. **BUT**: When the form is fully loaded, Lazarus reads `velectrnav.lfm` file
5. Line 72 of .lfm file has: `Header.MainColumn = -1`
6. This **overwrites** the programmatic setting back to `-1` ✗

### Evidence

From `velectrnav.lfm` (line 63-74):
```pascal
object vstDev: TLazVirtualStringTree
  Left = 1
  Height = 440
  Top = 1
  Width = 389
  Align = alClient
  DefaultText = 'Node'
  Header.AutoSizeIndex = -1
  Header.Columns = <>
  Header.MainColumn = -1    ← THIS OVERRIDES THE CODE SETTING!
  TabOrder = 0
end
```

### Why This Happens

In Lazarus IDE:
- When you design a form visually, all component properties are saved to the .lfm file
- These properties are loaded when the form is created/shown
- The .lfm properties override programmatic settings made in constructors
- This is by design to ensure WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) in the IDE

## Solution

**Fix BOTH locations:**

1. **velectrnav.pas** (already done in PR #178):
   ```pascal
   vstDev.Header.MainColumn := 0; // Line 320
   ```

2. **velectrnav.lfm** (this fix):
   ```pascal
   Header.MainColumn = 0  // Line 72 (changed from -1 to 0)
   ```

## How It Works

With both changes in place:
1. The .lfm file loads with `MainColumn = 0`
2. The programmatic setting also sets `MainColumn := 0`
3. Both settings agree → tree indicators are displayed in column 0
4. The `toShowButtons` and `toShowTreeLines` options (already set) work correctly
5. Column 0 (width 30px) displays the "+"/"-" indicators

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open the project in Lazarus IDE
2. Verify that `velectrnav.lfm` line 72 shows `Header.MainColumn = 0`
3. Build and run the application
4. Open VElectrNav frame
5. Click "*" button to load devices
6. Verify that vstDev shows "+"/"-" indicators in the first (narrow) column
7. Click indicators to expand/collapse tree nodes

## Files Changed

- `cad_source/zcad/velec/connectmanager/gui/velectrnav.lfm` (line 72)
  - Changed: `Header.MainColumn = -1` → `Header.MainColumn = 0`

- Previous fix: PR #178 (code-only fix)
- This fix: Completes PR #178 by also updating the form file

## Lessons Learned

When working with Lazarus VirtualStringTree (or any Lazarus component):
- Always check BOTH the .pas code AND the .lfm form file
- .lfm properties can override programmatic settings
- For persistent properties, set them in BOTH locations to ensure consistency
- The form designer will save current property values to .lfm when you save the form
